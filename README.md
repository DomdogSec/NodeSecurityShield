# Node Security Shield

**Node Security Shield (NSS)** is an Open source Runtime Application Self-Protection (**RASP**) tool which aims at bridging the gap for comprehensive NodeJS security by enabling *Developer* and *Security Engineer* to declare what resources an application can access.

Inspired by the Log4Shell  ([CVE-2021-44228](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228)) vulnerability which can be exploited because an application can make arbitrary network calls, we felt there is a need for an application to have a mechanism so that it can declare what privileges it allows in order to make the exploitation of such vulnerabilities harder by implementing additional controls.

In order to achieve this, **NSS (Node Security Shield)** has **Resource Access Policy (RAP)**

### Resource Access Policy (RAP)

**Resource Access Policy** is similar to **CSP**([Content Security Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP)).

It lets the developer/security engineer declare what resources an application should access. And **Node Security Shield** will enforce it.

## Installation

### Install *NodeSecurityShield* using npm

```bash
npm install nodesecurityshield
```

## Usage

```jsx
// Require Node Security Shield
let nodeSecurityShield = require('nodesecurityshield');

// Enable Attack Monitoring and/or Blocking
nodeSecurityShield.enableAttackMonitoring("Unique-App-Id",resourceAccessPolicy ,callbackFunction);
```

### **Sample *resourceAccessPolicy [BASIC]***

```jsx
const resourceAccessPolicy  = {
  "outBoundRequest" : {

      "blockedDomains" : ["compromised.domdog.io"],
    
      "allowedDomains" : []
   },
	"executedCommand": {

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
        "allowedCommands": ["pwd"]
=======
        "allowedCommands": ["pwd" , "(node)[ ](helper\/)[a-z|0-9]*(.js)"]
>>>>>>> Stashed changes
   }
};
```

- **`outBoundRequest`:** defines the accepted behaviour for `Outbound Requests`
    - **Note:** blockedDomains hold precedence over allowedDomains.
    - **i.e.,** requests checked against blockedDomains first then allowedDomains.
- **`executedCommand`:** defines the accepted behaviour for `Command Execution`
    - `allowedCommands` Array accepts `String` . You can pass a RegEx to allow a pattern of commands.
    - The default behaviour is to block all command executions. Provided, RAP has `executedCommand` property defined.
    - When the above RAP is used,
        - `pwd` command is allowed to execute and
        - `.js` files inside `helper` are allowed to spawn as node processes.
    - **Note:** Avoid usage of `.*` in regex. As this will allow the execution of any command after a pipe `|`.

### **Sample *callbackFunction* to log RAP violations to console.**

```jsx
var callbackFunction = function (violationEvent,violations,violationLimitPerMinReached) {
  console.log(JSON.stringify(violationEvent,null, 4));
}
```

- ***`violationEvent` -** RAP violation which occurred. It is presented as a CSP violation.*
- ***`violations` -** RAP violation count. Resets to ZERO every minute.*
- ***`violationLimitPerMinReached` -** true if RAP violations count exceeds 'maxViolationsPerMinuteâ€™ [ an option in RAP]*
- **To Block an Attack** - throw an error
    
    ```jsx
    throw new Error("Request Blocked. It violates declared Resource Access Policy.")
    ```
    

### **Sample violationEvent**

```jsx
{
    "csp-report": {
        "document-uri": "https://Unique-App-Id",
        "blocked-uri": "https://compromised.domdog.io:443",
        "violated-directive": "connect-src",
        "effective-directive": "connect-src",
        "original-policy": "{\"outBoundRequest\":{\"blockedDomains\":[\"compromised.domdog.io\"],\"allowedDomains\":[]}}",
        "disposition": "report",
        "status-code": 200,
        "script-sample": "",
        "source-file": "Error\n    at TLSSocket.obj.<computed> [as connect] (/mnt/c/Ironwasp/Product/NodeSecurityShield/lib/hook.js:20:25)\n    at Object.connect (_tls_wrap.js:1606:13)\n    at Agent.createConnection (https.js:126:22)\n    at Agent.createSocket (_http_agent.js:273:26)\n    at Agent.addRequest (_http_agent.js:232:10)\n    at new ClientRequest (_http_client.js:302:16)\n    at request (https.js:310:10)\n    at Object.get (https.js:314:15)\n    at /mnt/c/Ironwasp/RD/Node/SimpleVulnerableNode/routes/ssrf.js:19:19\n    at Layer.handle [as handle_request] (/mnt/c/Ironwasp/RD/Node/SimpleVulnerableNode/node_modules/express/lib/router/layer.js:95:5)"
    }
}
```

- **`document-uri:`** contains Unique-App-Id, passed during initialization of NSS
- **`blocked-uri`:** domain of the outbound request which violated RAP
- **`violated-directive`:** `connect-src` is a synonym for `Outbound Request` likewise `script-src` is a synonym for `Command Execution`
- **`original-policy`:** violated Resource Access Policy (RAP)
- **`source-file`:** Stack Trace of where this violation.

## Integrating with Sentry

### **Sample *resourceAccessPolicy to integrate with [Sentry](https://sentry.io/)***

```jsx
const resourceAccessPolicy  = {
  "outBoundRequest" : {

      "blockedDomains" : ["compromised.domdog.io"],
    
      "allowedDomains" : []
    },
	"executedCommand": {

        "allowedCommands": ["pwd" , "(node)[ ](helper\/)[a-z|0-9]*(.js)"]
   },
	"reportUri": "https://ingest.sentry.io/api/6011856/security/?sentry_key=",

};
```

- **`outBoundRequest`:** defines the accepted behaviour for `Outbound Requests`
    - **Note:** blockedDomains hold precedence over allowedDomains.
    - **i.e.,** requests checked against blockedDomains first then allowedDomains.
- **`executedCommand`:** defines the accepted behaviour for `Command Execution`
    - `allowedCommands` Array accepts `String` . You can pass a RegEx to allow a pattern of commands.
    - The default behaviour is to block all command executions. Provided, RAP has `executedCommand` property defined.
    - When the above RAP is used,
        - `pwd` command is allowed to execute and
        - `.js` files inside `helper` are allowed to spawn as node processes.
    - **Note:** Avoid usage of `.*` in regex. As this will allow the execution of any command after a pipe `|`.
- **`reportUri` :** Sends Violations to a given endpoint. As violations are similar to Content Security Policy violations. Any CSP monitoring solutions can be used. We used the Sentry endpoint in the above RAP.

### **Sample *resourceAccessPolicy [Advanced]***

```jsx
const resourceAccessPolicy = {
    "outBoundRequest" : {
    
        "blockedDomains" : ["compromised.domdog.io"],
        
        "allowedDomains" : ["domdog.io","*.domdog.io", 
           
            {
                "domains": [
                    "domgo.at",
                ],
                "modules": [
                    {
                        "file": "\/routes\/ssrf.js",
                    },
                    {
                        "file": "\/node_modules\/axios\/",
                    }
                ]
            },
            {
                "domains": [
                    "cluster0-shard-00-00.lb9jm.mongodb.net",
                    "cluster0-shard-00-01.lb9jm.mongodb.net",
                    "cluster0-shard-00-02.lb9jm.mongodb.net"
                ],
                "modules": [
                    {
                        "file": "\/node_modules\/mongodb\/"
                    }
                ]
            }
          
        ]
    },
		"executedCommand": {

            "allowedCommands": ["pwd" , "(node)[ ](helper\/)[a-z|0-9]*(.js)"]
	   },
    
    "reportUri": "https://endpoint-to-send-violations",
    
    "maxViolationsPerMinute": 50
  }
```

- **`outBoundRequest`:** defines the accepted behaviour for `Outbound Requests`
    - **Note:** blockedDomains hold precedence over allowedDomains.
    - **i.e.,** requests checked against blockedDomains first then allowedDomains.
- **`executedCommand`:** defines the accepted behaviour for `Command Execution`
    - `allowedCommands` Array accepts `String` . You can pass a RegEx to allow a pattern of commands.
    - The default behaviour is to block all command executions. Provided, RAP has `executedCommand` property defined.
    - When the above RAP is used,
        - `pwd` command is allowed to execute and
        - `.js` files inside `helper` are allowed to spawn as node processes.
    - **Note:** Avoid usage of `.*` in regex. As this will allow the execution of any command after a pipe `|`.
- **`reportUri`:** Sends Violations to a given endpoint. As violations are similar to **Content Security Policy** violations. Any CSP monitoring solutions can be used. We used the Sentry endpoint in the above RAP.
- **Module Specific Control:** `allowedDomain` Array accepts Objects with following
    - `domain`: Array of domains which are to be allowed for provided files.
    - `modules`: Array of Objects containing file paths. Only outbound Requests made through these files to specified domains are allowed.
- **`maxViolationsPerMinute`:** Maximum number of violations to be sent to the `reportUri`.
If not specified, the default value (*100 violations*) is used.
